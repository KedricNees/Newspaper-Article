        <p>Senator Dexhart and running nominee Leslie Knope rumored to have a relationship scandal.

        Dexhart admitted to the relationship but was he being truthful? No, he wasn’t as proof came along that the relationship was fake, and the case was closed.</p>

      <p>(rest his soul) kissing behind the stage.
          This puts major pressure on Knope and her campaign because the town needs someone they can trust, and this scandal did not help her case. </p>

          <div class= "father">
      <h2> Knope Crashes Funeral </h2>
      <p>Bobby Newport’s father, owner of Sweetums candy incorporated, died recently and Newport was crushed.
         At his ceremony Knope claims to have been going to apologize to Newport for throwing shade at Newport’s father during one of her campaign speeches.
         She drove her campaign bus into the ceremony of remembrance for Newport’s father. As you can imagine it looked very bad for Knope. She claims it was on honest mistake and coincidence.
          She went and apologized to Newport that day and Newport admits that he will be voting for Knope.

      <h2> Knope Exposed </h2>
      <p>Knope was recently exposed as not being born in Pawnee, as her book says. She was born in Eagleton IN and then raised in Pawnee.
         This caused an uproar in her campaign because the people want someone in office who was born and raised in Pawnee. It also makes her look like she can’t be trusted,
          even though she claims she didn’t know that she was born in Eagleton until the media and her mother told her. She reclaims herself by saying that it doesn’t matter where you are born.
          It matters on where you choose to be raised. This redeems her in her campaign for running for city council. </p>

        <h2> Knope’s Campaign Picks Up </h2>
          <p> Leslie Knope and her campaign have been struggling to stay afloat. Maybe its because of all of the uproar about the scandals. Or maybe its her not being born in Pawnee.

      <p>Or maybe its her possibly being the first woman on the city council. But after she got her new campaign manager, Ben Wyatt, things start to be picking up.
       She got a tour bus and started speaking around Indiana and has gained a lot of supporters. Things are looking better for Knope and a little scary for Bobby Newport. </p>

      <h2> Election Results </h2>
    <p>  The election went up and down for both canadines many times so as you can imagine the election was a very nerve-racking time for both.
       As time passes by, they get nervous until the results come in and reveal that Bobby Newport won by 21 votes. So Knope calls for a recount.
        After the recount the information reveals that Leslie Knope has won by 21 votes. Newport says, “I’m just glad the campaign is finally over”.
       It is a glorious day for Leslie Knope the first councilwoman in office. </p>
